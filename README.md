# Data-List-AI-Model
This real-time based project aims to streamline the process of applying AI models to user-provided datasets.
File Upload: You're greeted with a clean, modern interface where you can upload a CSV file.
Automated EDA: Once you upload a file, the application automatically performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). It sends your data to the Gemini API, which returns a detailed report including a data overview, a preview of your data, and an analysis of each column.
Interactive Analysis: After the initial EDA, a sidebar appears with a menu of further analysis tasks you can perform, such as Classification, Regression, or Clustering.
AI-Powered Reports: Selecting a task will generate a new report, explaining the methodology, simulated results, and interpretations, all formatted in easy-to-read cards.
New Look & Feel: The entire user interface has been redesigned to be professional and focused on the data analysis workflow.
I've updated the core logic, the user interface, and the instructions sent to the AI to facilitate this new functionality. Here is the code that implements these changes
